	<h1 id="installation">Installation Readme</h1>

	Installing an AppVet tool requires two main steps:
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Step 1. Configure AppVet:</b> AppVet must be configured to connect to and 
	interact with the (online) tool. This is done by modifying the tool's corresponding tool adapter used by AppVet.</li>
	<li><b>Step 2. Install and configure the tool:</b> The tool must be configured to 
	connect to and interact with AppVet. This is done by modifying the tool's 
	<code>ToolProperties.xml</code> file.</li>
	</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT!</b> If the tool already exists online and is accessible to 
AppVet, then <i>AppVet should be configured to connect to that existing tool and 
Step 2 should be skipped</i>.
